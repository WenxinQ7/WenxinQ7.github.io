    Yuan was born in Nantong, Jiangsu, a small but nice city in east coast of China.
    She spent her undergraduate years in Fudan University in Shanghai, where she got her
    Bachelor's degree in chemistry. After that, she earned her Ph.D. degree in Chemistry
    in Michigan State University under the direction of <a class="extlink" target="_blank" href="https://hamanngroup.weebly.com">Prof. Thomas Hamann</a>.
    During her research she realized that scientists spend too much time on repeated work,
    which is a waste of resource. She decided to explore the area of computer science
    to realize the automation of processes in scientific research as well as in daily life.
    Now she is studying computer science at Northeastern University in Seattle.

    She also plays video games like

    <a class="extlink" target="_blank" href="https://playbattlegrounds.com/main.pu">PUBG</a> (PUBG is a better game than Fortnite yay!).
    She likes various genres of music from <a class="extlink" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melodic_hardcore"> melodic hardcore</a> to <a class="extlink" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_music">indie</a>.
